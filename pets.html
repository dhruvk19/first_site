            <p>
                I have 3 dogs. Brutus is one of them. He is a fit and active German Shepard. He loves playing with the ball, not fetch though! If I throw the ball, he will sprint after it but keep it. If I try to run after him to get it back, he will waddle away wagging his tail almost mocking me. Moments like these bring a smile to my face.
            </p>

                Even though he has this playful side, when needed he is the BEST guard dog (apart from the fact that he is terrified of fire crackers). If anyone new comes home, his bark will be heard by all the neighbors. He can sprint like no other animal (even a cheetah). He also makes sure the other 2 dogs behave themselves!
